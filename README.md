# Landing Page Assessment

Landing page for an assessment. The project's specs are:

- Use of Vanilla CSS.
- The page topic is up to me.
- The turning cards are MVPs.
- Form's fields just as placeholders.
- No need to develop neither the header not the footer.
- Colors and font as close to the originals as possible.
- Responsive design for different breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Notes

No guidelines about how to approach the layout, so I decided to go for the desktop-first approach.
